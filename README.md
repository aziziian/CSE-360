# CSE 360 - Question & Answer CRUD Application

## Overview
This project implements a CRUD-based application for managing questions and answers with input validation. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete questions and answers in a simple question-answer system. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles with classes for `Question`, `Answer`, and a container for managing lists of these objects.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new questions and answers.
- **Read**: Retrieve existing questions and answers.
- **Update**: Modify the text of questions or answers.
- **Delete**: Remove questions or answers from the system.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid inputs for adding questions and answers, handling edge cases like empty text or invalid question IDs.
